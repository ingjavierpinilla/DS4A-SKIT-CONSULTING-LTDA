# DS4A-SKIT-CONSULTING-LTDA
Project developed to create a machine learning model that was able to predict the time it would take to develop a software project. This project was developed by the Data Science for All Team 70 

To run the web application please clone the project and run Home_Skit_Consulting.py

The initial step of the project was the reception of a database with the logs of each one of the developers since the beginning of the project until the end.

The final product was a statistical analysis of the data (available in extras) plus a web application specifically designed to display information and use the prediction model (developed with python/dash) that was hosted at AWS
